Notebooks for the MMS summer school 2021

Most of the Notebooks in this repository are adapted from Alexander Hinneburg's notebooks to go along with Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning". 
The originals can be found here: https://gitlab.informatik.uni-halle.de/apyae/PRML/-/tree/master
